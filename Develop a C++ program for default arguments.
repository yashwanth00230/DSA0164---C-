    cout << "Area of square with side 7: " << calculateArea(7) << endl;
    cout << "Area of rectangle with length 3.5 and width 2.5: " << calculateArea(3.5, 2.5) << endl;

OUTPUT:-
Area of rectangle with length 5 and width 10: 50
Area of square with side 7: 49
Area of rectangle with length 3.5 and width 2.5: 8.75
