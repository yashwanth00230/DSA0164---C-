OUTPUT:-
Entering main block...
Initial object count: 0
Object created. Current count: 1
Entering inner block...
Object created. Current count: 2
Object created. Current count: 3
Current object count: 3
Leaving inner block...
Object destroyed. Current count: 2
Object destroyed. Current count: 1
Back in main block...
Current object count: 1
Leaving main block...
Object destroyed. Current count: 0
